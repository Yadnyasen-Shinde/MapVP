//we team the students of VPKBIET  are building a PBl project for our campus.as our college campus is huge that's 
why the new comers to our college get confused to find there way towards their desired place or building this same problem was faced by us when we were new to the campus
so here's a solution to this problem is that we are buildind a wedsite which give directions and the uniqe part of this website is that we are
istalling a QR Code in campus area when that QR will get scan by any scanner that QR code will link to our website and the the website will provide options like main building,canteen etc after selecting their desired place the website will provide route to their location.
